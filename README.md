Gauge
=====

Gauge Grid is designed to allow, not only quick grid based placement of columns, but also defining columns within the grid divs.
Gauge Grid utilizes css calc() in order to maintain 10 px gutters between all columns. Columns are all percentage based, and
coming in a col-1 through col-12 variety. Additionally there are wide-1 through wide-12 classes for defining the width of the
columns you'd like to work in. Gutter spacing is maintained by the col-# classes.
